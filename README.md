* For easier understanding, I am going to call Tableau Server "Ray's Tableau Server".

In my other github repository, I have shown how you can connect Tableau Desktop with Cloudera Hadoop Server  for data source publishing & connection.
(https://github.com/rainmankim/tableau_server_cloudera_data_extraction)

<http://www.example.com>
In this reposito




This repository will show you the following in the following order:
- (1) Connect Tableau Desktop with Cloudera Hadoop Server
- (2) Extract necessary data (with custom SQL if necessary)
- (3) Publish data source onto "Ray's Tableau Server" with emedded authetification as LIVE data source
- (4) From "Ray's Tabealu Server", change the data from LIVE to EXTRACT  (takes a while)
- (5) Open a new Tableau Desktop instance and connect to the publisehd data source in "Ray's Tableau Server"
- (6-optional) Set refresch schedule for extracted data
```


### Step 1.  Let's open up Tableau Desktop and connect to Cloudera Hadoop with your credentials

### Step 2. Next, connect to Cloudera Table.  And I have written custom SQL query because the DB is too big(You can extract the DB as a whole)
<img align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62319355/105798924-3d395000-5fce-11eb-99e2-7ab2811a9fd9.png" alt="tableau_cloudera_connection image">

### Step 3. Next, we shall now publish the databse onto "Ray's Tableau Server"

### I recommend publishing this with "Embedded Password" setting with Live connection (because it often fails when you try to extract first)
#### If you choose "prompt user", it will ask for your password every single time. 
#### Alternatively, you can choose to publish as "prompt user" and you can still change to "Embedded Password" in "Ray's Tableau Server".
#### I will show you in step 4

### Step 4A. Now let us go to "Ray's Tableau Server".  
#### Search for the published data soruce. 
#### If you had published as "Prompt User", you can change to "Embedded Password" authetification instead.

### Step 4B.  Change the data connection from LIVE to EXTRACT  (takes a while)
<img align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62319355/105820676-d4b19980-5ff4-11eb-9b60-ce1b78c4d3dc.png" alt="Live to extract">

#### Once you click "Extract", "Ray's Tableau Server" will start to extract from Cloudera Database.

#### You will receive an email upton extraction (at least that is how it is configured).
#### In addition, you can monitor the extraction process in real-time as shown.

### Step 5. Once data source has been extracted on the Tableau, let us connect to the data.
#### Now, you will experience much less loading of data as compared to live connection.
#### You may ask "Why not just extract from the very start?"  The biggest reason is that it can throw an error when you extract at the start.

### Step 6. (Optional) You can set refresh schedule on the Extract on "Ray's Tableau Server" easily.
